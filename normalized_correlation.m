function [normalized_r, normalized_r2, rx, ry, rxy] = normalized_correlation(X,Y,varargin)
% Computes the correlation between two random variables normalized by the reliability of the two variables. 
% The normalized correlation is equal to corr(x,y) / sqrt(corr(x,x) * corr(y,y));
% 
% X and Y are [M x N1] and [M x N2] matrices with the same number of rows. Each column is assumed to be an i.i.d. sample of the random variable. 
% The correlation between column vectors of the same matrix is used as a measure of the reliability of each random variable. 
% 
% Assumes that the test-retest correlation of each variable is greater than 0. An error is thrown if the average test-retest correlation is below 0.
% 
% Example with a perfectly correlated signal and independent noise.
% Normalized correlation should equal 1.
% nd = 10000;
% sig = randn(nd,1);
% X = randn(nd,3) + sig*ones(1,3);
% Y = randn(nd,4)*2 + sig*ones(1,4);

% 2016-03-04: The original function calculated standard errors based on a parametric Gaussian
% approximation, and these errors were returned as the third and fourth argument of the function.
% This approximation only applies to raw not noise-corrected values, and thus I removed these
% additional outputs.

% 2016-10-28: corr to nancorr to allow for NaN inputs
